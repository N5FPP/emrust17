## RTFMv2

The version [v0.2.0] of the Real Time for the Masses framework, `cortex-m-rtfm`,
has ([finally]) been released. The most relevant changes since v0.1.x are:

[finally]: https://github.com/japaric/cortex-m-rtfm/pull/34

[v0.2.0]: https://crates.io/crates/cortex-m-rtfm/0.2.0

- v2 is simpler. v1 used a bunch of tokens -- ceiling tokens, priority tokens,
  preemption threshold tokens and task tokens -- for memory safety; this made
  the API rather boilerplatery. Now most of the tokens as well as the
  boilerplate are gone. Porting applications from v1 to v2 should see a
  reduction of about 10 to 30% in lines of code.

- v2 has even less overhead. A long standing [issue] with the borrow checker
  that required   using `Cell` or `RefCell` as a workaround has been fixed.
  Making the `Resource` abstraction truly zero cost.

[issue]: /rtfm-overhead/#a-nonzero-cost-pattern

- v2 fully supports Cortex-M0(+) devices. Now all the Cortex-M devices have the
  same level of support in `cortex-m-rtfm`. Not only that but there's also a
  [port] of this version of RTFM for the MSP430 architecture -- with the exact
  same API.

More details can be found in the accompanying [blog post].

The release took (way) longer than I expected (as usual). However, writing the
blog post in parallel to the documentation for the v0.2.0 release made me
realize some areas where things could be simplified further -- "This seems
harder to explain than it should be" or "This setting seems to be repeated a lot
of times but doesn't really increase readability". These last minute changes led
to making the `app!` macro even less boilerplater-y by providing sensible
defaults, reducing the overhead of global critical sections (by half) and
sharing of even more code between the Cortex-M and the MSP430 ports.

## Community highlight

This week highlight is [bobbin].

[bobbin]: https://www.bobbin.io/

"Bobbin is an open-source, cross-platform, vendor-independent development system
for embedded programming in the Rust programming language. It integrates with
existing proprietary and open-source tools and aims to provide comprehensive
Rust libraries for MCUs, boards, and peripheral devices, along with clear
documentation including practical examples."

It's always great to see how other people approach the same problem you are
trying to solve. Lots of chances for "cross pollination". It would be great to
see [bobbin] integrating with existing Rust concurrency frameworks like RTFM.

## TODO

- Blog post about Rust on MSP430

- Continue working on the HAL.

- Launch an initial version of the areweembeddedyet.com site.

- Start a series of blog posts about developing the robotic application.

- Finish cleaning the crate that supports the BLE400 development board and
  announce on u.r-l.o.
