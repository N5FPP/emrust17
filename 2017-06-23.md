## Beyond Cortex-M

The community has been making great progress on using Rust on bare metal
contexts other than Cortex-M microcontrollers. [@pftbest] has been working with
MSP430 microcontrollers and [@ahixon] has been working with Cortex-A processors
(bare metal style!). So we have been [discussing] how to extend [svd2rust] to
support these two architectures -- right now svd2rust only supports Cortex-M
micros.

[discussing]: https://github.com/japaric/svd2rust/pull/117
[svd2rust]: https://github.com/japaric/svd2rust
[@pftbest]: https://github.com/pftbest
[@ahixon]: https://github.com/ahixon

As a result of the discussion there we have decided to refactor some bits out of
the [`cortex-m`] crate, which is a core crate for developing Cortex M apps, into a
[common] crate that can be shared by the `cortex-m` crate and its MSP430
counterpart: the [`msp430`] crate. This will let us reducing the coupling
between the crates that svd2rust produces and `cortex-m`; those crates would
then be able to depend on the common crate rather than on `cortex-m`.

## Breaking the (Cortex-M) world for the greater good

I have been [postponing] a few [breaking changes] in a few crates core to the
Cortex-M ecosystem but I think we now a have big enough batch to land all of
them along with the required refactorings for adding multi architecture support
to svd2rust.

[postponing]: https://github.com/japaric/cortex-m/milestone/1
[breaking changes]: https://github.com/japaric/cortex-m-rt/milestone/1

I have written a [lengthy RFC] on the most user visible breaking change which
changes how we register exception / interrupt handlers today. Overall the
change brings wins in ergonomics and would let us solve some long standing
[borrow checker limitations] in core synchronization primitives that live in
`cortex-m` and [`cortex-m-rtfm`].

## WS2812B

I wrote a [demo application that drives a 24x WS2812B LED ring][demo]. This demo
exercises the DMA abstractions that I proposed last week. Thanks to the use of
the DMA this demo can achieve rendering speeds of up to 160 FPS (1 frame =
changing the color of the 24 LEDs) with only 15% CPU usage with a CPU clocked at
8 MHz.

Quite a few people asked how to work with these LEDs from Rust so I included
[documentation] on how these LEDs work and of how the application controls them.

## HAL and circular buffers

The HAL [discussion] continued this week with a focus on [abstractions for using
the DMA][dma] with other peripherals. I proposed
a [circular buffer abstraction][] (see second half of the comment) that can be
used with the DMA and peripherals that work as data sources like the ADC (Analog
to Digital Converter). Based on [feedback] I further [refined] the abstraction to
make it more robust to data races and more general purpose.

## Unstable features survey

The "which unstable features you have to use for embedded development" [survey]
I posted last week indicates that 100% of people agrees that the `panic_fmt`
lang item and Xargo are the #1 blocker for making embedded development possible
on the stable channel. The second most used unstable feature, according to the
survey, is the `const fn()` feature. That was a surprise to me; I was expecting
`asm!` to end up second but it ended up third.

## Community highlight

[@pftbest] has been killing it with their work on Rust on MSP430
microcontrollers. They have [forked] svd2rust to add support for MSP430
microcontrollers and then created a device crate for the [MSP430G2553]
microcontroller. They have also been [replicating] the [core] crates we use for
Cortex M development but tailored for MSP430 development.

## TODO

- Finish landing multi arch support in svd2rust

- Land scheduled breaking changes in `cortex-m` and `cortex-m-rt`, and deal with
  fall out in the rest of the ecosystem (e.g. `cortex-m-quickstart` and
  `cortex-m-rtfm`).

- Revamp `cortex-m-rtfm` to remove borrow checker limitations and reduce
  runtime overhead (no need for `RefCell`s anymore)

- Continue working on the HAL. Hopefully we'll reach some consensus on DMA
  abstractions soon.

- Launch an initial version of the areweembeddedyet.com site. I'd like to make
  sure MSP430 is in good shape enough (i.e. documented) to list the awesome work
  @pftbest has been doing.

- Start a series of blog posts about developing the robotic application. Best to
  wait for the RTFM revamp before starting that.

- Finish cleaning the crate that supports the BLE400 development board and
  announce on u.r-l.o.
