# Weekly status report

From 2017-06-09 to 2017-06-16

## Robotic application

I published the code of my [wheeled robot] on GitHub :tada:. This served as a
way of verifying the usefulness and completeness of the HAL traits I proposed as
a starting point last week. To complete my application I had to create an API to
use the DMA (Direct Memory Access) (\*) functionality; this API wasn't part of
the original HAL proposal.

(\*) The DMA peripheral provides hardware support for asynchronous memory
transfers that occur *in parallel* to the execution of the main program. The DMA
works with pretty much other microcontroller peripheral and it's vital to keep
the CPU load low: Instead of sending a string byte by byte over a serial
interface in a blocking fashion you can start a DMA transfer that will serialize
the string in the background and free up the CPU to work on something else.
Although very useful the DMA is also very easy to misuse (in C): for instance
you could start a DMA transfer to fill some buffer on the stack and then
free that buffer while the DMA transfer is still ongoing; the DMA will continue
writing to this "freed" memory which if reused by the program would cause UB.

## HAL & DMA

The HAL [discussion] continued this week. I proposed the [DMA API] I created for
my robot for inclusion in the HAL. As the DMA is core to the asynchronous
operation of any non-trivial program we are still discussing if the proposed API
is flexible enough to support all the common use cases.

## Roadmap issue update

This week I updated the "Usage in resource constrained" [roadmap issue] with the
results of the u.r-l.o survey I conducted last month. I also added to the issue
links to the different ongoing community projects. As per Niko request I also
wrote a [few paragraphs] about the progress in this exploration area.

## Unstable features survey

I also started [a survey of unstable features] commonly used in embedded
programs. With the goal of identifying the main blockers for doing embedded
development on stable. I kinda know which features are the main blockers so this
is more of a confirmation.

## areweembeddedyet

I surveyed all the crates, that I know of, that provide [support for a
development board] with the goal of comparing their level of peripheral (HAL)
support and collecting a list of applications built with them. I think that
prominently listing the supported hardware along with projects built with Rust
and that hardware in a future areweembeddedyet.com site would serve as a great
way to get new embedded developers and contributors.

## Community highlight

This week highlight is [@adamgreig]'s [radar demo]! Which can detect someone's
breathing at a range of about 6 meters. The application samples the radar's
analog signal at a blazing speed of 4 Mbps and then sends the data over an
ethernet connection. Yes, this *is* a [microcontroller][] (single core, 200 MHz
max CPU frequency and 200 KB of RAM) with an ethernet connection. This demo uses
the [cortex-m-quickstart] template, the [cortex-m] crate, a device crate
generated using svd2rust and [@whitequark]'s [smoltcp] crate which is a TCP
implementation free of heap allocations for resource constrained systems.

# TODO

- Continue working on the HAL
- Start a series of blog posts about developing the robotic application
- Launch an initial version of the areweembeddedyet.com site
- Finish cleaning the crate that supports the BLE400 development board and
  announce on u.r-l.o.
