## cortex-m.next

I finished moving the Cortex-M ecosystem to its next minor version. All the
following crates and their documentation have been updated.

- [`cortex-m-quickstart`](https://crates.io/crates/cortex-m-quickstart/0.2.0)
  - [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/japaric/cortex-m-quickstart/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v020---2017-07-07)
- [`cortex-m-rt`](https://crates.io/crates/cortex-m-rt/0.3.0)
  - [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/japaric/cortex-m-rt/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v030---2017-07-07)
- [`cortex-m-semihosting`](https://crates.io/crates/cortex-m-semihosting/0.2.0)
  - [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/japaric/cortex-m-semihosting/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v020---2017-07-07)
- [`cortex-m`](https://crates.io/crates/cortex-m/0.3.0)
  - [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/japaric/cortex-m/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v030---2017-07-07)
- [`stm32f103xx`](https://crates.io/crates/stm32f103xx/0.7.0) and other device
  crates
- [`svd2rust`](https://crates.io/crates/svd2rust/0.11.0)
  - [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/japaric/svd2rust/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v0110---2017-07-07)

The most user visible breaking change is that registration of exceptions and
interrupts is now done "one by one" rather than "all at once". In a nutshell:

``` rust
// register handler for the SYS_TICK exception
exception!(SYS_TICK, tick);

fn tick() {
   println!("TICK");
}

// register handler for the TIM2 interrupt
interrupt!(TIM2, tock, locals: {
    // now you can even add state to your handler!
    counter: u32 = 0;
});

fn tock(locals: &mut TIM2::Locals) {
    locals.counter += 1;

    println!("TOCK");
    println!("(This handler has been called {} times)", locals.counter);
}
```

The macros are documented [here][1] and [here][2]. As usual there are examples
for this in the [quickstart] template.

[1]: https://docs.rs/cortex-m-rt/0.3.2/cortex_m_rt/#macros
[2]: https://docs.rs/svd2rust/0.11.1/svd2rust/macro.interrupt.html
[quickstart]: https://docs.rs/cortex-m-quickstart/0.2.0/cortex_m_quickstart/#examples

The second most user visible change is that the binary size of all the programs
that depend on the cortex-m-rt crate should have significantly shrunk. The exact
number depends on the number of interrupts the device has but for 60 interrupts
I'm seeing a reduction of about 400 bytes. These gains come from reducing bloat
we had, and still have, around the default exception / interrupt handlers (cf.
[japaric/cortex-m#19]). The bloat will likely be fully eliminated once LLVM's
mergefunc pass [improves]; then we should see another binary size reduction of
about 10-20% of what we've seen today.

## Multiarch support in svd2rust

[`svd2rust`] is a tool that converts System View Description (SVD) files to Rust
crates. These files describe all the hardware (peripherals and registers) a
device has. `svd2rust` turns this file into a crate that provides an API to
access all the device hardware in a type safe manner.

[`svd2rust`]: https://crates.io/crates/svd2rust

SVD files, being a creation of ARM, have been traditionally used to describe
Cortex-M microcontrollers, but these files are flexible enough to describe
microcontrollers with different architectures.

With the help of the [`dslite2svd`] tool one can convert dslite files, basically
TI's version of SVD files, to the SVD format. TI provides dslite files for
pretty much all their MSP430 microcontrollers. That's means that we not only
have a [database of Cortex-M SVD files][cmsis-svd] but also
a [database of MSP430 SVD files][energia].

[`dslite2svd`]: https://github.com/m-labs/dslite2svd
[cmsis-svd]: https://github.com/posborne/cmsis-svd/tree/master/data
[energia]: https://github.com/japaric/svd2rust/issues/122#issuecomment-313337126

However, svd2rust only supported producing crates for Cortex-M microcontrollers
... until [a few days ago][pr]. `svd2rust` now supports both the Cortex-M and
the MSP430 architectures. Now the Rust community has hardware support for
hundreds of Cortex-M devices and hundreds of MSP430 devices. :tada:

## Rust on MSP430

[@pftbest] has finished porting a bunch of core Cortex-M crates to the MSP430
architecture. Among them we have:

[@pftbest]: https://github.com/pftbest

- [`msp430`](https://github.com/pftbest/msp430)
- [`msp430-rt`](https://github.com/pftbest/msp430-rt)
- [`msp430g2553`](https://github.com/pftbest/msp430g2553). A device crate
  generated using the latest svd2rust.

And I have landed a proper MSP430 target in [rustc]. With a bit more polish
the development workflow for MSP430 microcontrollers will be on par with Cortex
M microcontrollers'.

## RTFM v2

I have continued working on [the next minor version] of the [Real Time For the
Masses][] (RTFM) framework. I have reworked my [original rtfm! proposal] and
re-implemented the `rtfm!` macro as a compiler plugin. The result was a much
simpler interface with better error messages.

[the next minor version]: https://github.com/japaric/cortex-m-rtfm/pull/34
[Real Time For the Masses]: https://crates.io/search?q=cortex-m-rtfm
[original rtfm! proposal]: https://github.com/japaric/cortex-m-rtfm/pull/31

I have tested the latest `rtfm!` macro on [two] non-trivial [applications] and
I'm quite happy with the results. This `rtfm!` version will become the next
release of the RTFM framework. I mostly just have to write documentation about
the macro to do the release.

[two]: https://github.com/japaric/2wd/pull/4
[applications]: https://github.com/japaric/ws2812b/pull/1

Also, given the great progress on the MSP430 front I'm contemplating porting
RTFM to MSP430. With the new compiler plugin architecture the port shouldn't be
that hard to do and it may even be possible to share a good amount of code
between the two ports.

## Community highlight

I want to thank [@whitequark] for their invaluable feedback on several RFCs and
PRs that were required to move the Cortex-M ecosystem to its next minor version.
They also wrote the [`dslite2svd`] tool which has been instrumental to make
`svd2rust` work for MSP430 microcontrollers.
