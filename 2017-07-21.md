## `panic_fmt` RFC

After some back and forth with the Rust team I updated and submitted [the
`panic_fmt` RFC]. The RFC had a good initial reception and now it must run its
course.

## Xargo RFC

I'm still waiting for feedback from the Rust team on the Xargo RFC.

## Reducing binary size

Given that crates and tooling are shared between the Cortex-M and MSP430
ecosystems and that MSP430 developers are very concerned about binary size
because of the small memory footprints of MSP430 devices, improvements that
MSP430 developers make in their ecosystem end up flowing into the Cortex M
ecosystem and vice versa.

This week a long standing [issue] about binary size bloat filled in the cortex-m
crate was fixed by [@pftbest], a MSP430 developer, by [patching svd2rust], a
tool common to both ecosystems. Furthermore, @pftbest backported a LLVM patch to
fix an LLVM bug that the svd2rust patch triggered *only on the Cortex-M
architecture*. @pftbest rocks :heart:.

[issue]: https://github.com/japaric/cortex-m/issues/19
[patching svd2rust]: https://github.com/japaric/svd2rust/pull/130
[@pftbest]: https://github.com/pftbest

Another binary size improvement came from the Cortex-M camp: we improved the
[startup routine], which takes care of initializing RAM, to be leaner. This
improvement also flowed into the MSP430 ecosystem because we share the [r0]
dependency. On MSP430 the change not only reduced binary size but also improved
boot times.

[startup routine]: https://github.com/japaric/r0/pull/4
[r0]: https://crates.io/crates/r0

With these two changes the size of a minimal Cortex-M program went down from 836
bytes (532 bytes of .text + 304 bytes of vector table) to 412 bytes (112 bytes
of .text + 304 bytes of vector table). A reduction of 424 bytes or about 50%.
:tada:

The gains on MSP430 are similar: the size of a minimal MSP430 program went down
from 192 bytes (160 bytes of .text + 32 bytes of vector table) to 96 bytes (64
bytes of .text + 32 bytes of vector table). A reduction of 96 bytes or about
50%. :tada:

## RTFMv2

The [next iteration] of the Real Time For the Masses framework now has (compile
fail) tests, updated documentation and plenty of examples. I'm now writing a
blog post about it. The v0.2.0 release is imminent!

[next iteration]: https://github.com/japaric/cortex-m-rtfm/pull/34

## Community highlight

[@cr1901] ported their keyboard converted [firmware] to the RTFM framework and
became the first production user of the MSP430 port of the RTFM framework :+1:.
They got a modest savings in binary size of about 30 bytes out of this.

[@pftbest] gets the gold medal this week for solving a long standing binary size
bloat [issue] in the Cortex M ecosystem. :1st_place_medal:

## TODO

- release RTFM v2 + blog post

- Blog post about Rust on MSP430

- Continue working on the HAL.

- Launch an initial version of the areweembeddedyet.com site.

- Start a series of blog posts about developing the robotic application.

- Finish cleaning the crate that supports the BLE400 development board and
  announce on u.r-l.o.
