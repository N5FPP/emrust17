# Weekly status report

From 2017-07-08 to 2017-07-14

## RFCs

A few weeks ago the Rust core team, the Rust subteams, and core Rust
contributors met at the Mozilla All Hands week to discuss outstanding Rust
issues, specially related to the 2017 roadmap. One of the covered topics was
making progress towards making embedded / no-std development possible on stable.

From the blockers identified from [this survey] Xargo, `panic_fmt`,
`compiler-builtins` and `asm!` were discussed. From those four a stabilization
path was identified for Xargo and `panic_fmt`, and this week I have written the
RFC proposals for those stabilization paths. The TL;DRs are:

[this survey]: https://github.com/rust-embedded/rfcs/issues/31

### Xargo

Land a minimal part of Xargo's functionality into Cargo. Basically Cargo will be
able to (cross) compile the `core`, `std` or `test` crates from the `rust-src`
component on stable. This RFC has a much smaller scope than [a previously
proposed RFC]: no support for Cargo features or custom source, no elimination of
the sysroot and implicit dependencies, no publishing the standard crates on
crates.io, etc.

[a previously proposed RFC]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1133

### `panic_fmt`

A `#[panic_implementation]` attribute will be added to the language. It will
behave like the `#[global_allocator]` attribute and will let you specify the
behavior of `panic!` in no-std context. Example below:

``` rust
// cf. https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/panic/struct.PanicInfo.html
use core::panic::PanicInfo;

// use this instead of `#[lang = "panic_fmt"]`
#[panic_implementation]
fn my_panic(pi: &PanicInfo) -> ! {
    // prints: "program panicked at 'reason', src/main.rs:3:4"
    write!(&MY_STDERR, "program panicked at {}", pi).ok();

    // .. and diverge somehow ..
}
```

I'm now waiting on feedback from the Rust team before submitting the RFCs. I
want to make sure we are on the same page.

## RTFMv2

I continued working on the [next iteration] of the [Real Time for The Masses]
framework. Relevant changes since last week:

[next iteration]: https://github.com/japaric/cortex-m-rtfm/pull/34
[Real Time for The Masses]: https://crates.io/crates/cortex-m-rtfm

- the `rtfm!` macro has been renamed to `app!`

- the macro parser has been refactored into its [own crate].

- I have made the fields `init.path` and `idle.path` optional. If omitted these
  fields default to the paths `init` and `idle` respectively, which is what most
  people will use, I expect.

- I have replaced all the panic! / unwraps in the proc macro implementation with
  proper error handling (:heart: error-chain :heart:). You now get nice
  backtraces when there's an error in the contens of the `app!` macro. For
  example:

[own crate]: https://github.com/japaric/rtfm-syntax

``` rust
app! {
    device: blue_pill::stm32f103xx,

    tasks: {
        SYS_TICK: {
            priority: 1,
            resources: { SYST }, // <- wrong delimiter
        },
    },
}
```

produces:

```
error: proc macro panicked
  --> examples/blinky.rs:16:1
   |
16 | / app! {
17 | |     device: blue_pill::stm32f103xx,
18 | |
19 | |     tasks: {
...  |
24 | |     },
25 | | }
   | |_^
   |
   = help: message: Error: parsing
           Caused by: parsing `tasks`
           Caused by: parsing task `SYS_TICK`
           Caused by: parsing `resources`
           Caused by: expected Bracket, found Brace
```

I believe this is good as the error messages can get without proper span
information.

## RTFM on MSP430

The main motivation for moving the `app!` macro parser into its own crate was to
share code between this crate and the port of the RTFM framework to
[the MSP430 architecture](https://github.com/japaric/msp430-rtfm). Yup, you
can now use this very same macro and the task and resources model to write
concurrent applications for MSP430 microcontrollers :tada:.

With this refactor it should be straightforward to port the RTFM frameworks to
other architectures like AVR once they become available on upstream rustc.

## Device families

This week a [discussion] started on creating a HAL tailored for device
*families*. The main goal here is to share as much code as possible between
devices that belong to the same family.

[discussion]: https://github.com/rust-embedded/rfcs/issues/33

To elaborate:

We currently use [svd2rust] to get hardware support for a bunch of different
devices. svd2rust transforms one SVD file into one device crate; that crate
provides a low level register API to use the hardware. Then we have
[embedded-hal] which is a HAL, a set of traits, that can be implemented for
device crates and provides a higher level API that "erases" all the device
specific details like registers and magic hexadecimal values.

[svd2rust]: https://github.com/japaric/svd2rust
[embedded-hal]: https://github.com/japaric/embedded-hal

The issue with the current *implementation* of this approach is that depending
on the vendor one SVD file could represent one microcontroller or a few very
similar microcontrollers; this actually results in a bunch of duplicated code
because vendors tend to reuse peripheral designs across their products. In
Rust-speak the types `stm32f100xx::TIM2`, `stm32f101xx::TIM2` and
`stm32f102xx::TIM2` and their APIs are *semantically* the same but the code is
duplicated *across* device crates so the types are not equal in the eyes of the
Rust compiler. This may not sound too bad because that duplicated code was
generated by a tool but this problem carries over the next layer: where a human
has to implement the HAL traits on top of these crates:

``` rust
// crate: stm32f100xx-hal-impl

impl hal::Timer for stm32f100xx::TIM2 {
    // implementation that some person wrote
}

// crate: stm32f101xx-hal-impl

impl hal::Timer for stm32f101xx::TIM2 {
    // the exact same implementation has to be written here
}

// crate: stm32f102xx-hal-impl

impl hal::Timer for stm32f102xx::TIM2 {
    // more code duplication here
}
```

We want to avoid this. We can do that by de-duplicating the types at the device
crate level. So instead of having svd2rust generating a bunch of duplicated code
in different crates, we want it to generate something like this:

``` rust
// crate: stm32-common

// declare the type and its API *once*
pub struct TIM2 { .. }

impl TIM2 { .. }

// crate: stm32f100xx
extern crate stm32_common;

// then just re-export it across device crates
pub use stm32_common::TIM2;

// crate: stm32f101xx
extern crate stm32_common;

pub use stm32_common::TIM2;
```

We have yet to [figure out] how to structure such re-export system but we have
been analyzing how much duplication such system would avoid. A [tool] was
written to spot peripherals that are the same across different SVD files. For
some vendors the de-duplication is very significant: across 52 SVD files from
the Silabs vendors 1802 peripherals are declared (i.e. svd2rust would have
generated 1802 different types) but there are only *55* unique instances. So
with the re-export logic 1747 types would have not been duplicated.

## Community highlight

[@cr1901] has ported [a MSP430 application] from C to Rust. The application is
an AT keyboard protocol to XT keyboard protocol converter. The result of the
rewrite was a functional 2KB Rusty firmware that exactly fitted in a miniscule
[MSP430G2211] microcontroller. Apparently the Rust version ended up being
slightly larger than the original C version binary size wise. @cr1901 will be
looking into further optimizing the application for binary size. I hope they'll
give my MSP430 port of the RTFM framework a try for their next iteration!
