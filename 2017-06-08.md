## Progress on the [svd2rust] milestone

[svd2rust]: https://github.com/japaric/svd2rust

This week I landed a [comprehensive test suite] in the svd2rust repo. We are now
testing against [this] SVD file database. Of the 490 files in that repository
svd2rust was initially working with 253 of them. Of the difference 99 were
labeled as not conforming to the SVD specification so we don't count those as
svd2rust bugs.

[comprehensive test suite]: https://github.com/japaric/svd2rust/pull/104
[this]: https://github.com/posborne/cmsis-svd/tree/python-0.4/data

After that first PR I landed [a small fix] that increased the number of passing
SVD files by 71. Then a contributor landed [another fix] that increased that
number by 44.

[a small fix]: https://github.com/japaric/svd2rust/pull/106
[another fix]: https://github.com/japaric/svd2rust/pull/109

Our final count now is 368 of 391 files. Which leaves only 23 more files to fix.
Sadly we are done with the low hanging fruit and dealing with [the long tail]
will take much more effort: we need to add features rather than fix bugs to
support the remaining files.

## HAL discussion

I have [started] the HAL [discussion] with an initial set of HAL traits that
supports the following peripherals / functionality:

[started]: https://users.rust-lang.org/t/rust-for-embedded-development-where-we-are-and-whats-missing/10861/87
[discussion]: https://github.com/japaric/cortex-m-hal/issues

- Input Capture
- Pulse Width Modulation
- Quadrature Encoder Interface
- Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)
- Serial (UART) interface
- Timer (timeouts)

I have designed the HAL with maximum code reuse in mind by not tying it to a
single asynchronous model. The HAL can be used in blocking mode, with the
`futures` crate or with an async / await model (requires support for generators
in the compiler) through the different macros in the [`nb`] crate. The HAL API
is minimal but composable to allow building [higher level abstractions][higher]
in a generic and device agnostic manner.

[`nb`]: https://github.com/japaric/nb
[higher]: https://japaric.github.io/cortex-m-hal/cortex_m_hal/index.html#generic-programming-and-higher-level-abstractions

A reference implementation of these traits is available in the [`blue-pill`]
crate.

## [Blue pill] support

[Blue pill]: http://wiki.stm32duino.com/index.php?title=Blue_Pill

The "Blue pill" is the third development board that I have to support to as part
of the contract. All the board support is in the `blue-pill` crate, which is
also the reference implementation of the HAL traits I proposed (see previous
section).

Enough functionality of this board is now supported (and published) to build the
robot application I planned as part of the contract work.

## Ecosystem growth

I want to highlight some work that's going on in the ecosystem and that's not
being done by me.

[@vitiral] is working on [defrag], a safe defragmenting memory manager for
microcontrollers, and on [bridge-rpc], a RPC protocol for microcontrollers.

[defrag]: https://crates.io/crates/defrag
[bridge-rpc]: https://github.com/vitiral/bridge-rpc

[@Susurrus] is working on a [FAT32 driver] for bare-metal systems where no
dynamic memory allocator is available.

# TODO

- Put the code of the robot application on GitHub
- Start a series of blog posts about developing the robotic application
- Incorporate feedback to the areweembeddedyet.com draft
- Launch an initial version of the areweembeddedyet.com site
- Continue working towards the svd2rust milestone
- Finish cleaning the crate that supports the BLE400 development board and
  announce on u.r-l.o.
