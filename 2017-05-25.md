# Weekly status report

From 2017-05-19 to 2017-05-25

## Gathering requirements from current and would-be users

See the 2017-05-needs.md file for details. But these have been the most
requested items in decreasing order of perceived need:

- Target support. Support for targets which aren't currently supported in LLVM,
  rustc or by the standard library.

- A Hardware Abstraction Layer. An API free of device specific details to ease
  writing programs that work across different devices.

- Documentation. Improve documentation of crates, tools, and programming
  patterns.

- Tutorials. How to develop embedded applications. More walkthrough style than
  regular documentation.

- Then tooling. Improve existing tooling or make it easier to use.

- Tied with improving the no_std / embedded crate ecosystem.

Among other stuff.

## svd2rust test suite

svd2rust is tool that converts SVD files, which describe the hardware of a
microcontroller, provided by vendors into Rust crates that expose an API to use
the hardware in a type safe manner.

Tested svd2rust against
this
[database](https://github.com/posborne/cmsis-svd/tree/aa4721af946a253d18c8737b01d23e9c88a42e84/data) of
584 SVD files.

Of those 584 files svd2rust worked correctly with 396 files; it generated code
without errors and the generated code compiled successfully. Of the 188 files
that didn't work with svd2rust 88 files were not compliant with SVD
specification so the problem were the files and not svd2rust. The other 100
files are real svd2rust bugs and/or unimplemented features. That gives svd2rust
a success rate of 396 out of 496 or around 80%.

A [milestone] has been created to track the work required to make svd2rust work
with those 100 files.

## Rust on the nRF51822

The [nRF51822] is a microcontroller with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
functionality from Nordic Semiconductor. There are two C stacks that can be used
to use the BLE functionality: SoftDevice by Nordic Semiconductor (closed
source / binary blob), and the NimBLE stack used by the RTOSes MyNewt and Zephyr
(open source).

I have decided to look into the SoftDevice stack first based on feedback from
would-be users. I found this particular comment compelling.

>  We provide the ANT firmware for all devices which support it on the market
>  (Nordic, TI, MediaTek, etc) and do the integration with their firmware. For
>  the nRF51 we provide the ANT integration for the S210 and S310 SoftDevices to
>  Nordic. In my position, I have to help customers with the whole product from
>  PCB layout up to OS integration and mobile apps, but for embedded software, I
>  support the Nordic SDK mostly on S210, S310, S212 and S312 SoftDevices. The
>  Nordic SDK provides hooks for our D52 Starter Kit. Every customer I have seen
>  so far uses the SoftDevice for production product, whether that is ANT, BLE,
>  Gazelle, etc. *The SoftDevice is certified (saving customers cost) and Nordic
>  is fairly receptive to customer requirements*, although they do tend to make
>  a lot of breaking changes between SDK and SoftDevice releases.

(emphasis mine)

So far I have a [Cargo project](https://github.com/japaric/ble400) that
integrates with Nordic build system, works on Linux and Windows, and has
auto-generated bindings (bindgen). I have built two basic applications using the
Nordic SDK and will look into a BLE demo next.

## TockOS rustup

Helped the Tock project
to
[upgrade their nightly version](https://github.com/helena-project/tock/pull/370).

## Updated [Xargo documentation]

[Xargo documentation]: https://github.com/japaric/xargo/pull/144

According to the feedback from the u.r-l.o thread.

## Miscellaneous open source work

Contributions and discussion have been increasing across all the embedded
repositories I maintain since last week. It seems there has been an uptake in
embedded Rust activity since my u.r-l.o post. IRC activity has also increased
and I have been answering questions over there as well.

## TODO

- BLE demo for the nRF51822
- Start producing blog posts about embedded development.
- Work towards the svd2rust milestone
- Deep dive into TockOS build system. (Still waiting for my development board.)
