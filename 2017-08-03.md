# Weekly status report

From 2017-07-29 to 2017-08-03

This is the final one! This is the final week of my contract, but fret not! I'm
still going to be around working on my open source projects as time allows.

Unfortunately, this week I have been rather busy with non-work stuff because I'm
moving to Europe next week and I couldn't get much coding / reviewing done. So,
I figured it'd be a good idea to sum up the work done these past 10+ weeks and
highlight important work that still needs to be done.

## What has been done

### MSP430 has reached parity with ARM Cortex-M

This is what I'm most proud of; best of all this is not my accomplishment alone
-- quite far from it -- but mostly the work of the MSP430 community. The MSP430
community may be small right now but it's full of very capable individuals:
[@pftbest], [@cr1901], [@awygle] -- thank you all for your hard work.

[@pftbest]: https://github.com/pftbest
[@cr1901]: https://github.com/cr1901
[@awygle]: https://github.com/awygle

The ARM Cortex-M architecture has been supported by Rust for a long time (like 3
years). Its ecosystem is in good shape now: there's a [clear path] to get Rust
running on virtually any device; [core][] [building][] blocks; svd2rust, a
[tool][svd2rust] to easily get hardware support for almost any device; Real Time
for The Masses (RTFM), a bare metal [concurrency] framework; and [Tock], an
operating system.

[svd2rust]: https://crates.io/crates/svd2rust
[concurrency]: https://crates.io/crates/cortex-m-rtfm
[Tock]: https://www.tockos.org/

The MSP430 backend has been enabled in rustc for less than a year but all the
knowledge gained from using Rust on ARM Cortex-M has been ported to this newer
target. You'll find the same [core][msp430] [building][msp430-rt] blocks, that
svd2rust works with the help of [msp430-svd] and a [port] of the Real Time For
the Masses framework.

[port]: https://github.com/japaric/msp430-rtfm

I'm confident that once AVR supports lands in tree we'll see some similar fast
paced progress.

### svd2rust device support

To do I/O on microcontrollers you have to manipulate registers, special regions
of memory to which you write magical numeric values to control the hardware.
Dealing with these as pointers is way too error prone so it's common to create
an API to give meaningful names to the addresses and to the values that you
usually read / write to these address. However, that is a lot work and also
error prone to do manually, basically you have to translate a reference manual
(PDF) into an API. It can also lead to an overall inconsistent ecosystem if
several people are working on different devices independently as they may
produce their APIs using different principles.

[svd2rust] solves all these problems. This tool converts SVD files -- System
View Description (SVD) is a format standardized by ARM that describes all the
peripherals a device or device family has -- into "device" crates that expose a
standard API to manipulate registers. With this tool you get a consistent API
regardless of the target device and you can produce all the code you need to
work with your device effortlessly. The generated API has been designed to be
zero cost and to prevent bugs like writing to the reserved parts of a register.

svd2rust has seen several of improvements in the last months. One of the big
improvements is that it now supports more SVD files than before. There's this
[database] of SVD files which we use as a test suite; of the 391 *valid* files
in that database svd2rust now works with 368 (94%) of them when months ago it
worked with only 253 (64%) of them.

[database]: https://github.com/posborne/cmsis-svd/tree/master/data

To support the remaining files svd2rust needs to support the [less common] SVD
features that those files use. Thankfully, interested users are already
[working] on them.

[less common]: https://github.com/japaric/svd2rust/issues/107
[working]: https://github.com/japaric/svd/pull/36

The other big improvement in svd2rust has been multiarch support. Originally
svd2rust was only meant to be used with ARM Cortex-M which is what the SVD
standard targets but turns out that there's a very similar format called dslite
from Texas Instrument (TI). TI uses this proprietary format for both their ARM
Cortex-M and MSP430 microcontrollers. Thanks to the [msp430-svd] tool you can
transform MSP430 dslite files into SVD files and then feed them to svd2rust.

### Clear instructions for starting out

The [quickstart] template and accompanying [blog post] provide instructions
to start developing embedded applications from scratch. It takes you from the
setup all the way to building a minimal application that uses the register API
that svd2rust produces. It even includes a comprehensive [troubleshooting guide]
in case you get stuck somewhere. (Now if people would just read the whole
documentation before asking questions on IRC my life would be easier ...)

[blog post]: http://blog.japaric.io/quickstart/
[troubleshooting guide]: https://docs.rs/cortex-m-quickstart/0.2.1/cortex_m_quickstart/#troubleshooting

### RTFMv2

[Real Time For the Masses][rtfm] (RTFM) is a concurrency framework that gives
you very efficient preemptive multitasking and resource sharing between tasks.
The framework uses zero device specific features so once it has been ported for
an architecture it works with *all* the devices of that architecture.

[rtfm]: https://docs.rs/cortex-m-rtfm/0.2.1/cortex_m_rtfm/

I released the [first version] of the RTFM framework before starting my contract
and released the [second version][] (v2) near the end of my contract. v2
improved performance, simplified the API a *lot* and added support for MSP430
microcontrollers.

[first version]: http://blog.japaric.io/fearless-concurrency/
[second version]: http://blog.japaric.io/rtfm-v2/

### Example applications

Quite a few people have picked up the quickstart template project, svd2rust and
the RTFM framework and started hacking to their heart content. Here's a list of
open source projects build with these crates / tools / framework:

- [A remote controlled wheeled robot](https://github.com/japaric/2wd). ARM
  Cortex-M
- [A LED ring controlled via serial interface](https://github.com/japaric/ws2812b).
  ARM Cortex-M
- [An AT to XT keyboard protocol converter](https://github.com/cr1901/AT2XT/).
  MSP430
- [A soldering iron](https://github.com/wose/ts100). ARM Cortex-M (WIP)
- [Bunch of small examples for the Blue Pill development board](https://github.com/japaric/blue-pill).
  ARM Cortex-M

And then we have other projects whose code has not been published yet.

- A DIY USB keyboard. At least 2 of them. ARM Cortex-M.
- [A radar demo](https://mobile.twitter.com/adamgreig/status/873901071013425152). ARM Cortex-M
- [A self balancing robot](https://mobile.twitter.com/japaricious/status/845697935572656128).

### HAL

For some people having an API that operates at the register level is all that
they need to build applications: they can create higher level APIs customized
for their application because they are familiar with a particular device or
vendor, and/or because they want maximum performance or leverage device specific
features. Other people don't want to bother with registers and want to use a
higher level API that hides device specific details *and* works across different
devices.

This higher level API is called a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL). There has
been work in this area in the [embedded-hal] repository. The repository contains
a *minimal* HAL in the form of a set of traits. Minimal here means that the HAL
is high level enough to abstract away device specific details but not too high
level to keep it straightforward to implement. Minimal also means zero cost but
flexible; the goal of this constraint is to encourage the creation of higher
level APIs on top of the minimal HAL -- we don't want to see high level API
directly manipulating registers in their implementations.

[embedded-hal]: https://github.com/japaric/embedded-hal

One particular aspect of the core of this HAL is that it is *async-agnostic*.
There are different ways to do I/O: in a blocking fashion, asynchronously using
futures, async/await or callbacks; the core of the HAL picks "no winner" in this
regard, instead the API can be easily "lifted" into blocking or asynchronous
code as needed. The [`nb`] crate is used to achieve this; [its documentation]
explains the exact mechanism.

[`nb`]: https://github.com/japaric/nb
[its documentation]: https://japaric.github.io/nb/nb/

The HAL currently covers:
timers,
[serial communication][serial],
[Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) Bus][spi], [Pulse Width Modulation][pwm],
[Quadrature Encoder Interface][qei] and Input Capture. But there's a lot of
functionality that still needs an API: digital
I/O,
[Analog to Digital Converter][adc],
[Digital to Analog Converter][dac], [CAN bus][can], etc.

### Rust on top of C frameworks

100% Rust applications are not the only way to write embedded applications in
Rust. You can also use Rust on top of C frameworks and libraries. Two examples
demoing this were developed:

- [Rust on the Particle photon][photon]. By binding
  the [Particle firmware][particle] applications that interfaced (WiFi) with
  Particle's cloud service were demoed.

[photon]: https://github.com/japaric/photon-quickstart
[particle]: https://docs.particle.io/reference/api/

- [Rust on the nRF51288][ble400]. By binding the [nRF SDK] an application that
  advertised itself as a Bluetooth device was developed.

[ble400]: https://github.com/japaric/ble400
[nRF SDK]: https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/Bluetooth-low-energy/nRF5-SDK

The main conclusion here was: it's possible to build applications for these
platforms by just calling Cargo (or rather, `xargo build`) given that the proper
build system-y work has been done before hand. "Possible" doesn't mean easy
though; these C frameworks have their build system, in both cases it was
`make`-based. Although it's possible to have Cargo invoke the frameworks' build
system that ended greatly increasing the build time so instead I opted for
shipping the C bits as binary blobs as part of the crate; this made build times
nearly instantaneous.

Apart from the build system side there was also the C binding side to take care
of. Here [`bindgen`] did a great job ... when C code was involved. The Particle
firmware is a mixture of C and C++ code; `bindgen` was not able to deal with the
C++ code because of the C++ features it used -- this is a known `bindgen`
limitation.

"raw" bindings don't make a good API because those bindings are `unsafe` to
use; it's necessary to build a safe Rustic API on top of the raw bindings to
make the crate usable. In the case of the Photon once I understood their
concurrency model it wasn't too hard to build a safe API that worked with
concurrent applications. OTOH, the nRF SDK was a nightmare to work with because
the API makes heavy use of function like C macros for initialization; `bingden`
doesn't create bindings for these so I had to manually port them to Rust macros.
Creating a "shim" for these function like C macros was not possible either
because they create static variables in their expansion.

### Other miscellaneous stuff

There has been a lot of other "small" changes in core Cortex-M crates and also
some changes in core MSP430 crates. It's interesting to note that in some cases
changes in Cortex-M crates were immediately ported to their MSP430
counterparts and vice versa, and in some other cases changes proposed by the
MSP430 camp also improved Cortex-M applications, and vice versa, because the
changes landed in crates common to both ecosystems.

The changes are too many to list here but the biggest one came from the MSP430
camp and reduced the binary size of a minimal application, an application that
initializes RAM and does nothing more, for *both* Cortex-M and MSP430
microcontrollers by 50% (!).

## Remaining challenges

There's been lot of progress but there's still lots to do.

### Visibility

A go to place to get information about how well supported a certain device is
has been requested quite a few times. Here "how well supported" is actually
asking if someone has developed an API that's higher level than the one you get
from using svd2rust. Some people are also looking for APIs tailored for specific
development boards.

I think this kind of information would be perfect to have in an areweembeddedyet
site. There's an [issue][areweembeddedyet] tracking progress on building such
site but there has not been much progress lately. IMO, building such site is
blocked on having someone with front end chops help design the site. Listing
device support is going to require some thinking: presentation wise we want to
group the devices per architecture, then by vendor and then by family in "one
axis"; in the other axis we want to show how much of the device functionality
has a high level API; maintenance wise this listing should be easy to update by
contributors because the number of supported devices will hopefully be
increasing all the time.

### Code reuse in HAL implementations

I wrote in detail about this particular problem in a [previous report]. The
TL;DR is that to use the HAL for a particular device someone has to implement
the HAL traits for the corresponding svd2rust generated crate. This is not a bad
thing in itself; the problem is that vendors design their devices to be very
similar within a device *family* but we are *not* exploiting this similarity to
our advantage. The result is that when Alice implements the HAL for device F101
and Bob implements the HAL for device F102 they are actually writing *exactly*
the same code so we have duplicated code with all the downsides it entails:
duplicated work, fixing in bugs in one place have to be manually applied in the
other place, etc.

[previous report]: https://github.com/japaric/emrust17/blob/master/2017-07-14.md#device-families

IMO, this has to be fixed in svd2rust proper. svd2rust has to become smart
enough to eliminate this code duplication in the device layer. If we fix this in
the lowest layer then all the other layers will benefit. As doing this early can
save us a *lot* of duplicated work I think it should be highly prioritized. The
tracking issue for this svd2rust change is [here].

### Growing the embedded crate ecosystem

I'd love to see the crates.io ecosystem filled with embedded crates to interface
with sensors and all other sorts of embedded devices as much as the next person
but it's going to take quite some work to get there. One of the requirements for
building this ecosystem is completing the HAL. For example, quite a few sensors
are digital these days and are interfaced using I2C or SPI so we need to settle
on the HAL for those interfaces.

In some other cases we'll need to build no-std crates like [smoltcp] but for
things like USB, Bluetooth, etc.

[smoltcp]: https://crates.io/crates/smoltcp

### Common initialization

The HAL that we have been working on exclusively deals with *doing I/O*. Even
when using this HAL programs have to take care of initialization of peripherals
in a device specific way. It would be great to also be able to initialize
peripherals in a device agnostic way. This device agnostic way would also be a
HAL but with very different requirements than `embedded-hal`; in initialization
being zero cost is not important and blocking or busy waiting during
initialization is totally fine.

There has been very little exploration in this area so far.

### Rust once, run everywhere

One of the best features of the standard library is that it works on a bunch of
different OSes and architectures. A program that uses the standard library can
be (cross) compiled for all sort of different platforms without any change. We
would like to be able to write embedded applications that can run on different
devices.

To accomplish this we are going to at least have to: settle on the HAL, figure
out how to do device agnostic initialization and deal with the code duplication
in svd2rust. Even with that out of the way there's the question of how to deal
with conditional compilation. `std` is highly portable because it deals with all
the platform specific details using conditional compilation. Conditional
compilation in `std` has the advantage that all the conditional "predicates" are
standard: target_os, target_arch, etc. In embedded code that won't be the case
because most predicates are related to the vendor and the device family.

I have written my thoughts on the matter in [this issue].

## Community highlight

This week [@wose] demonstrated that Rust can run on a ... [soldering iron].
Coolest thing I have seen in a while! Or maybe it's the hottest thing
:thinking:.

[@wose]: https://github.com/wose
[soldering iron]: https://github.com/wose/ts100

If people keep coming up with cool (and hot) stuff we should make a "This week
in embedded Rust" newsletter.
